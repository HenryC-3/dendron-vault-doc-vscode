# Wrapping Up

In the [[vs.1.7.api.get-started.your-first-extension]] topic, you learned how to create, run, and debug an extension. In the [[vs.1.7.api.get-started.extension-anatomy]] topic, you learned fundamental concepts to Visual Studio Code extension development. However, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg, and here are some suggested routes for furthering your VS Code extension development skills.

## Extension Capabilities

In this section, we split the [[vs.1.7.api.references.vscode-api]] and [[vs.1.7.api.references.contribution-points]] into a few categories, each with short descriptions as to what your extension could achieve. Validate that your extension idea is achievable by reviewing the [[vs.1.7.api.references.vscode-api]] or reading the [[vs.1.7.api.extension-capabilities.overview]] section for new extension ideas.

## Guides & Samples

We have a great collection of sample extensions that you can adapt from, and some of them include a detailed guide that explains the source code. You can find all samples and guides in the [[vs.1.7.api.extension-guides.overview]] or the [vscode-extension-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) repository.

## UX Guidelines

To help make your extension fit seemlessly into the VS Code user interface, refer to the [[vs.1.7.api.ux-guidelines.overview]], where you'll learn the best practices for creating extension UI and conventions for following the preferred VS Code workflows.

## Testing and Publishing

This section includes topics that help you develop high-quality VS Code extensions. For example, you can learn

- How to add [[vs.1.7.api.working-with-extensions.testing-extension]] for your extension
- How to [[vs.1.7.api.working-with-extensions.publishing-extension]] to the VS Code [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
- How to set up [[vs.1.7.api.working-with-extensions.continuous-integration]] for your extension
